    "A simplified data science process can be broken down into the following straightforward steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly state the problem you want to solve using data. Understand the business or research context. Examples:\n",
    "    - Recommendation Systems:\n",
    "        - Problem: An e-commerce platform wants to increase sales by recommending products to users.\n",
    "        - Definition: Define the problem as creating a recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their preferences, browsing history, and purchase behavior.\n",
    "        - Data Required: User behavior data (e.g., clicks, purchases, views), product information, user profiles, and possibly contextual data (location, time).\n",
    "        - Data Sources: Website and App Usage Analytics, Product Catalogs, User Profiles, and External Contextual Data.\n",
    "    - Healthcare Diagnosis:\n",
    "        - Problem: A hospital wants to improve early disease detection.\n",
    "        - Definition: Frame the problem as developing a predictive model for early diagnosis of diseases based on patient symptoms and medical history.\n",
    "        - Data Required: Patient medical records (symptoms, test results, medical history), diagnostic codes, and potentially external data (research papers, clinical trials).\n",
    "        - Data Sources: Electronic Health Records (EHR), Lab Results, Imaging Reports, and Medical Literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Gather the data required to address the problem. This might involve databases, spreadsheets, or other sources. Some problems could be:\n",
    "    - Inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data can lead to unreliable results. \n",
    "    - Data may not be readily available or may exist in various formats and locations, making it challenging to collect and consolidate.\n",
    "    - When integrating data from different sources, ensuring data compatibility (e.g., consistent data formats, units, and identifiers) can be challenging.\n",
    "    - Collecting and using data may be subject to legal restrictions, contracts, or industry regulations. Ensuring compliance is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and organize the data. Remove errors, handle missing values, and format it for analysis. (TODAY)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Analysis**: Explore the data to understand its characteristics. This can involve basic statistics and simple visualizations.(NEXT WEEK)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Building**: Choose a straightforward algorithm or method to build a predictive or descriptive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Training**: Train your model using the cleaned data. Adjust model settings if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess how well the model performs. Use simple metrics to measure its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Communication**: Share the findings and insights with others, making sure they understand the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Iterate**: If necessary, repeat the process with additional data or make improvements based on feedback."
