    "1. **`.` (Dot)**: Matches any character except a newline character. For example, `a.b` matches \"axb,\" \"a2b,\" but not \"a\\nb.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `*` (Asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, `ab*c` matches \"ac,\" \"abc,\" \"abbc,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `+` (Plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, `ab+c` matches \"abc,\" \"abbc,\" but not \"ac.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `?` (Question Mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group. For example, `ab?c` matches \"ac\" and \"abc\" but not \"abbc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `|` (Vertical Bar): Acts as an OR operator and allows you to match either of two patterns. For example, `cat|dog` matches \"cat\" or \"dog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `[]` (Square Brackets): Defines a character set. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel, and `[0-9]` matches any digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `[^]` (Caret within Square Brackets): Defines a negated character set, matching any character not listed. For example, `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit character.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `()` (Parentheses): Creates a capturing group to capture a subpattern. For example, `(abc)+` matches \"abc,\" \"abcabc,\" and captures \"abc\" as a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `(?...)`: Defines a non-capturing group or sets options within the group. For example, `(?:abc)+` is a non-capturing group.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `*?`, `+?`, `??`: These are non-greedy quantifiers. They match as little text as possible. For example, `a*?b` matches \"ab\" in \"aab,\" not the entire \"aab.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `^` (Caret, outside square brackets): Matches the start of a string. For example, `^abc` matches \"abc\" at the beginning of a string.\n",

    "12. `$` (Dollar Sign): Matches the end of a string. For example, `abc$` matches \"abc\" at the end of a string."
