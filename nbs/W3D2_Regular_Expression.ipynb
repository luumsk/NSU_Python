    "\n",
    "2. `*` (Asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, `ab*c` matches \"ac,\" \"abc,\" \"abbc,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `+` (Plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, `ab+c` matches \"abc,\" \"abbc,\" but not \"ac.\"\n",

    "5. `|` (Vertical Bar): Acts as an OR operator and allows you to match either of two patterns. For example, `cat|dog` matches \"cat\" or \"dog.\"\n",

    "6. `[]` (Square Brackets): Defines a character set. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel, and `[0-9]` matches any digit.\n",

    "8. `()` (Parentheses): Creates a capturing group to capture a subpattern. For example, `(abc)+` matches \"abc,\" \"abcabc,\" and captures \"abc\" as a group.\n",

    "9. `(?...)`: Defines a non-capturing group or sets options within the group. For example, `(?:abc)+` is a non-capturing group.\n",
